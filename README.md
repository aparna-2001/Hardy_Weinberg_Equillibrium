# Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium Calculator

This project implements Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium in Python to compute allele and genotype frequencies and visualize their relationships.

## Features
- Calculates p and q from input genotype counts
- Computes expected genotype frequencies (p², 2pq, q²)
- Visualizes results using simple plots

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib (for plotting)

## Usage
Run the script and modify values to observe how genotype frequencies change under equilibrium.
